# Wealth inequality. What can or should we do?

Before class, listen to [this podcast](https://www.latimes.com/podcasts/story/2021-10-11/podcast-the-times-bruces-beach-update) about a particular case where a piece of land was restored to a Black family.

Among other things, we will discuss:

1. This quote from the end of the podcast
>  If you can inherit generational wealth, you can inherit generational debt. That’s debt that Manhattan Beach owes to the Bruce family. It’s debt that California and this nation owes to many more families like the Bruces. --- California State Senator Steve Bradford
2. Nozick argued for the fundamental importance of individual property rights. How might empirical evidence about racial wealth inequality and its origins reframe that normative argument?
3. The question of racial reparations is much broader. If time allows, we will consider a 2019 exchange between [Senator Mitch McConnell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQz7kL_qrE4) and author [Ta-Nehisi Coates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcCnQ3iRkys) about reparations. What role might knowledge of history and quantification of wealth gaps play in these debates?
