If you are missing class, here is a form where you can tell us!

- [Excused absence form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0-bu6tZjii3VAzJdL9JiayywoWC14U4xXrWgwjIqwA7Maxg/viewform). For requesting an excused absence from lecture or discussion
- [Lecture make-up form](https://forms.gle/1gh7irUBoDRgmTNW9). For lectures that are missed which we haven't excused
- For non-excused absences from discussion, you should do the discussion activity on your own and submit in the Canvas assignment associated with that discussion
