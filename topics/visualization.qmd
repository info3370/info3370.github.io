> Prerequisites. You should first install R and RStudio as described in the [R4DS Prerequisites](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro#prerequisites). If you are unfamiliar with the layout of RStudio, see the [User Guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user).

In this discussion section, we will

- load the data from [Jencks 2002](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20027737) Table 1
- visualize the data using `ggplot`

# Getting started

In your table groups, introduce yourselves

- what made you interested in this class
- how much experience do you have with R and `ggplot`?

Whoever has the least experience---you are the coder! Arrange yourselves so that everyone can see the coder's screen.

## Prepare the environment

Open a new R Script by clicking the button at the top left of RStudio. Save your R Script in a folder you will use for this exercise.

Paste the code below into your R Script. Place your cursor within the line and hit `CMD + Enter` or `CTRL + Enter` to run the code and load the `tidyverse` package.

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
```

You will see action in the console. You have added some functionality to R for this session!

The code below will load the data.

```{r, comment = F, message = F}
data <- read_csv(file = "../data/jencks_table1.csv")
```

When you run this code, the object `data` will appear in your environment pane.

## Explore the data

Type `data` in your console. You can see the data!

`country` | country name
`ratio` | ratio of 90th to 10th percentile of household income
`gdp` | Gross Domestic Product Per Capita, expressed as a proportion of U.S. GDP
`life_expectancy` | life expectancy at birth

You can think of `ratio` as how many dollars a high-income household receives for each dollar that a low-income household receives.

For details on the data, see Jencks (2002) Table 1.

## Produce a graph

We are ready to produce a graph! The code below will produce a simple graph.

```{r}
data |>
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ratio, y = gdp)) +
  geom_point()
```

Let's break this code down into pieces

- `data` tells R to start with the object `data`
- `|>` is called the pipe operator. It passes the `data` object down to the function in the next line
- `ggplot()` is a function that creates a plot environment
- the argument `mapping = aes(x = ratio, y = gdp)` tells `ggplot()` how variables in the data will correspond to elements of the plot. We will visualize `ratio` on the x-axis and `gdp` on the y-axis
- `+` tells `ggplot()` we will add a new layer on the next line
- `geom_point()` tells `ggplot()` to add a layer of points to the graph

## Customizing your graph

In your group, create additional layers with additional lines connected by `+`. Be creative! Here are some ideas:

- label the axes with `scale_x_continuous(name = "your text here")` and `scale_y_continuous(name = "your text here")`
- label countries using `geom_text` or `geom_text_repel`, with the aesthetic `label = country`

There are many possible graphs to make. An example is below.

```{r, echo = F}
data |>
  ggplot(aes(x = ratio, y = gdp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula = 'y ~ x',
              method = "lm", 
              se = F, 
              color = "black") +
  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(aes(label = country),
                           size = 3) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(),
                     name = "GDP as a Percent of U.S.") +
  scale_x_continuous(name = "Inequality\n90th percentile / 10th percentile\nof household income") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Interpret your graph

Once you are happy with your graph,

- write a few sentences explaining your graph
- discuss what questions you would like to ask next
