title: "Causal Interventions"
---

If we want to reduce inequality, we want to know the effect of an **intervention**: what would happen if some treatment went differently?

As a running illustration, this section considers the rapid expansion of higher education over the 20th century. We will discuss how completion of a college degree causally increases economic outcomes, especially for students unlikely to finish college.

This material draws on the following book:
