# Studying Social Inequality with Data Science

Together, we will generate new knowledge about social inequality using the tools of data science

- visualize economic inequality with graphs that summarize survey data
- connect theories about inequality to quantitative empirical evidence
- evaluate the effects of hypothetical interventions to reduce inequality
- conduct data analysis using the R programming language
