# Jan 30. Creating a ggplot

How have U.S. household incomes changed over time?

For the years 1962--2022, we used the [Current Population Survey](https://cps.ipums.org/) to prepare three datasets.

- p10.csv contains the 10th percentile of household incomes
- p50.csv contains the 50th percentile of household incomes
- p90.csv contains the 90th percentile of household incomes

Each table will be assigned one of the above datasets. You will make a scatterplot.

Some key functions we will cover together include:
- `read_csv` to load the data
- `ggplot` to prepare the plot
- `geom_point` and `geom_line` to plot data
