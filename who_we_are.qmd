Working with data to understand inequality brings me joy and meaning, as I first discovered as a college student years ago. I hope to share that joy with you! Other joys of mine include hiking, surfing, and oatmeal with blueberries.

My research interests primarily focus on applying computational methods to important policy questions. Developing software and building tools is also something I love to do! In my free time I enjoy doing pretty much anything that’s active and outdoors and I particularly enjoy playing tennis, kayaking, and fishing.
