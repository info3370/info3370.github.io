Working with data to understand inequality brings me joy and meaning, as I first discovered as a college student years ago. I hope to share that joy with you! Other joys of mine include hiking, surfing, and oatmeal with blueberries.

I am passionate about using data to support patient-centered care and study gender inequality in fiction readership. I love binge-watching shows, hiking, and making food with friends. Excited to meet you in class!

My research interests primarily focus on applying computational methods to important policy questions. Developing software and building tools is also something I love to do! In my free time I enjoy doing pretty much anything that’s active and outdoors and I particularly enjoy playing tennis, kayaking, and fishing.

Hello everyone! I study Information Science and Government and am fascinated by understanding the world and how policies shape it through data. Outside of class I love watching 1950’s French movies, running, and cooking. Looking forward to meeting you all this semester!
