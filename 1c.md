# Using R

Today we will begin using R! R is a powerful tool for data analysis.

Before class, you should follow the instructions in [R4DS 1.4](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites) to

1. [Install R](https://cloud.r-project.org/), which is statistical software
2. [Install RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/download), which is a particular environment we will use to work with R
3. Install the `tidyverse` package as described in the book

If you have trouble, post a question in Ed or ask in office hours. If something goes wrong with your computer so that you aren't fully set up it'll be ok---for this class session we'll just begin to get familiar with the R environment.

After class, you may want to read the other parts of [R4DS 1](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) which provide an overview of the approach to data science taken by this textbook.
