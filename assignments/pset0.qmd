title: "Problem Set 0: Setting up R, RStudio, and Quarto"
subtitle: "**Info 3370. Studying Social Inequality with Data Science. Spring 2024**"
---

**Due: 5pm on Wednesday, January 24.**

In this exercise, you will install R, RStudio and
Quarto. The exercise will ensure that they are set up correctly so that
everybody is ready to dive into coursework.

## Install Software Requirements

You should follow the instructions in [R4DS](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) to:

1. [Install R](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro#r)
2. [Install RStudio](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/intro#rstudio)

Once R and RStudio are successfully installed, this also means that Quarto is
successfully installed because it comes bundled with RStudio.

Finally, you will need to open RStudio, select the Terminal tab, and execute
the following command: `quarto install tinytex` as demonstrated in the image
below.

## Download Problem Set

Next, download [this problem set](../assets/pset0/pset0.qmd) which is a
Quarto Markdown Document.

## Render the Problem Set

Finally, open the downloaded problem set in RStudio. You should then click
the "Render" button as shown in the image below.

This will run the R code and combine the output with the text in the document
into a PDF. By default, this PDF will be output in the same directory that
you saved `pset0.qmd` in. You will then submit the PDF on Canvas.

<!-- If you're not sure what your working directory is, run `getwd()` in your -->
<!-- RStudio console. This will print your working directory. You can set it to the place you've saved this file by clicking the top menu Session -> Set Working Directory -> To Source File Location. -->

## Issues

If you run into issues while attempting to render the Problem Set, be sure
to open a question on the
