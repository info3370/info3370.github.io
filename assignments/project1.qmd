title: "Project Work: March 21"
---

This is our first discussion devoted to the final project! Find your group in Phillips or in Upson. If you don't have a group, find the part of the room where TAs will help people form groups.

Your goals for this discussion are

- get to know your group members
- create a group for yourselves in Canvas
- discuss what broad topic you want to study
- try to propose a specific research question
- explore possible data sources

One group member should upload a paragraph to the Canvas discussion assignment

- tell us about your plans
- tell us if any group member was absent. If so, tell us if they have been in touch with you and working on the project this week

Next week (March 28), you will pitch your general plan to another group. In preparation for that, in order to get feedback. Think of today as a chance to get ready to make that pitch next week.
