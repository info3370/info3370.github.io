# Jan 23. Welcome to Info 3370 / 5371!

No preparation is needed before this class.

1. Make a name tag! We encourage you to put your name and pronouns
2. Meet others at your table
    - What was something fun for you over the break?
    - What are you looking forward to this semester?
3. Help us make our first seating chart: [tinyurl.com/Seats3370](https://tinyurl.com/Seats3370)

## Exercise

At each table, we have placed a visualization of inequality. Discuss:

- What is compelling about the figure?
- What do you find confusing?
- How would you explain this figure to someone who hasnâ€™t seen it?

Then we will discuss it as a class. Not every table has the same figure, so we will pick some groups randomly to walk the rest of us through each figure.

## Next class

See the [next page](1b) to see how to prepare before Wednesday's class.
