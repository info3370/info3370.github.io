If you are unfamiliar with the layout of RStudio, see the [User Guide](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user).\n\nIn this discussion section, we will\n\n- load the data from [Jencks 2002](https://www.jstor.org/stable/20027737) Table 1\n- visualize the data using `ggplot`\n\n# Getting started\n\nIn your table groups, introduce yourselves\n\n- what made you interested in this class\n- how much experience do you have with R and `ggplot`?\n\nWhoever has the least experience---you are the coder! Arrange yourselves so that everyone can see the coder's screen.\n\n## Prepare the environment\n\nOpen a new R Script by clicking the button at the top left of RStudio. Save your R Script in a folder you will use for this exercise.\n\nPaste the code below into your R Script. Place your cursor within the line and hit `CMD + Enter` or `CTRL + Enter` to run the code and load the `tidyverse` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou will see action in the console. You have added some functionality to R for this session!\n\nThe [data](../assets/data/jencks_table1.csv) can be loaded from the course website with the line below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata <- read_csv(file = \"https://info3370.github.io/assets/data/jencks_table1.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWhen you run this code, the object `data` will appear in your environment pane.\n\n## Explore the data\n\nType `data` in your console. You can see the data!\n\n- `country` country name\n- `ratio` ratio of 90th to 10th percentile of household income. You can think of this as how many dollars a high-income household receives for each dollar that a low-income household receives\n- `gdp` Gross Domestic Product Per Capita, expressed as a proportion of U.S. GDP\n- `life_expectancy` life expectancy at birth\n\nFor details on the data, see Jencks (2002) Table 1.\n\n## Produce a graph\n\nWe are ready to produce a graph! The code below will produce a simple graph.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata |>\n  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = ratio, y = gdp)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLet's break this code down into pieces\n\n- `data` tells R to start with the object `data`\n- `|>` is called the pipe operator. It passes the `data` object down to the function in the next line\n- `ggplot()` is a function that creates a plot environment\n- the argument `mapping = aes(x = ratio, y = gdp)` tells `ggplot()` how variables in the data will correspond to elements of the plot. We will visualize `ratio` on the x-axis and `gdp` on the y-axis\n- `+` tells `ggplot()` we will add a new layer on the next line\n- `geom_point()` tells `ggplot()` to add a layer of points to the graph\n\n## Customizing your graph\n\nIn your group, create additional layers with additional lines connected by `+`. Be creative! Here are some ideas:\n\n- label the axes with `scale_x_continuous(name = \"your text here\")` and `scale_y_continuous(name = \"your text here\")`\n- label countries using `geom_text` or `geom_text_repel`, with the aesthetic `label = country`\n\nThere are many possible graphs to make. An example is below.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](visualization_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Interpret your graph\n\nOnce you are happy with your graph,\n\n- write a few sentences explaining your graph\n- discuss what questions you would like to ask next\n",
