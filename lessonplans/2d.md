# Sampling for Population Inference

[Slides](../../assets/slides/6_Population_Sampling.pdf){: .btn }

This class introduces sampling for population inference. We will think about

- How would you design a sample to estimate unemployment?
	- Who would you survey?
- What mode of data collection?
	- Mail, phone, web, in person, etc.
- What if people didn't respond?
- How to get a high-quality sample while minimizing costs?

Then, we will discuss the [Current Population Survey](https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cps/), which is the official instrument for estimating the unemployment rate in the U.S.

# Accessing data

We will access data through the [Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS)](https://www.ipums.org/). The first dataset we will use is [IPUMS-CPS](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/).

During class, we will all [register for data access](https://uma.pop.umn.edu/cps/user/new?return_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcps.ipums.org%2Fcps-action%2Fmenu).
