# Machine learning

Machine learning is simply an extension of statistics. The basics are
the same:

- learn from training data
- evaluate in test data
- pick the learner that does the best
- predict for new cases!

The only difference with machine learning is that a huge number of
candidate learners are available to you. The pages that follow introduce
a few of those learners.
