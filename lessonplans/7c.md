# Example with OLS

This page walks through a sample submission for our PSID Income
Prediction Challenge.

There are four steps.

1.  Load data: `learning.csv` and `holdout_public.csv`
2.  Learn a prediction function in learning
3.  Predict for new cases in holdout_public
4.  Prepare submission

You should carry out these steps in an R script (not an .Rmd) so that
you can submit your R script with your predictions.

## 1. Load data

The first step is to load the data. For data access, see the previous
page.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
learning <- read_csv("learning.csv")
holdout_public <- read_csv("holdout_public.csv")
```

## 2. Learn a prediction function in learning

Example: OLS with past incomes as predictors

``` r
fit <- lm(g3_log_income ~ g1_log_income + g2_log_income,
          data = learning)
```

## 3. Predict for new cases in holdout_public

Start with `holdout_public` and mutate to change the `g3_log_income`
column from its current value of `NA` to the predicted values from your
model.

``` r
fitted <- holdout_public %>%
  # Predict using the estimated model
  mutate(g3_log_income = predict(fit, newdata = holdout_public))
```

# 4. Prepare submission

Create a data frame with two columns:

- `g3_id` (the identifier)
- `g3_log_income` (the predicted outcome)

``` r
for_submission <- fitted %>%
  select(g3_id, g3_log_income)
```

Save as a csv and upload to the [submission
site](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeCXspOpSiM5ScYHhbVx9TIbtHjtMbNUbm9T076NZsIP8ng4A/viewform?usp=sf_link)!

``` r
write_csv(for_submission,
          file = "example.csv")
```

When you upload, you will also upload

- the .R source code for your submission
- a brief text narrative telling us what strategy you used

If this were our submission, we would upload this [R source
code](../assets/code/example.R) and this [.csv file of
predictions](../assets/data/example.csv).
