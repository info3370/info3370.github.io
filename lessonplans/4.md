# Independent investigation

A key principle of this course is that you can take these tools to explore data _independently_ and ask your own quantitative empirical questions. We will practice this in class by randomizing into tables and then working collaboratively on a project in those tables. After several class sessions, we will present our findings to one another.

More details to come!
