# Exercise: Independent investigation

Data science is a creative endeavor. This class activity is an
opportunity to explore and think independently. You will

- Create your own quantitative empirical question
- Select data to explore that question
- Produce a visualization to tell a story
- Present that story to another group in the class

You’ve already learned tools that will be helpful

- Accessing data through IPUMS
- Preparing those data using R
- Producing a visualization with ggplot()

And we are here to help! Flag any of us down along the way.

We will focus on this class activity for several classes, and you will
then present your group’s findings to another group. Do not stress about
having the best findings—sometimes the most compelling findings are
those you least expect. We know your results will leave some questions
unanswered—it takes time to do research.

## Where do I start?

Pick a few variables that interest you! A great visualization often
involves only a few variables. You can pick them by looking through the
[IPUMS-CPS
documentation](https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/variables/group).

## I picked some variables! What next?

1.  Write down a question you’d like to understand using those variables
    For instance,
    - How did the proportion of families with incomes below \$30,000
      change from 1962 to 2022? Among those employed as computer
      programmers (see
      [OCC1990](https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/variables/OCC1990#codes_section)),
      did the proportion female change over time? How does poverty vary
      across metropolitan vs rural areas?
2.  Get the data
    - Download data from [IPUMS-CPS](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/)
    - Remember how we did this [in
      class](https://info3370.github.io/lessonplans/3a/)
3.  Prepare your data
    - Using the tidyverse!
    - Remember how we did this [in
      class](https://info3370.github.io/lessonplans/3b/)
    - Remember there might be missing value codes to `filter()` out
4.  Make a visualization
    - Remember this from [previous
      classes](https://info3370.github.io/lessonplans/2a/)
    - Remember this from [Problem Set
      1](https://info3370.github.io/assignments/pset1/)
5.  Think about how you’ll present to another group

We are all excited to learn from each other’s findings!

## FAQs: What is up with gender, sex, and race?

IPUMS-CPS contains `sex`, coded `Male` and `Female`. But people using
these data often write about gender gaps between “men” and “women.” This
might seem confusing, or even hurtful. The categorization of `race`
might also seem concerning. Let us explain a bit.

<details>
<summary>
<b>Why doesn’t the CPS keep up with the times?</b>
</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
As a long-running study, the CPS seeks to ask questions the same way
over time to allow comparisons across years. But as social science
understanding of sex and gender grows, we might realize the variables in
the data do not match the constructs we want to study.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<b>What is gender?</b>
</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Gender is a socially-construed categorization that refers to the social,
psychological, cultural and behavioral aspects of being a certain gender
identity. This includes expected norms, roles, and activities. Gender is
distinct from sex, is not binary, and varies from society to society
(<a href = "https://www.who.int/health-topics/gender">World Health
Organization</a>,
<a href = "https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/48642.html">Canadian Institutes of
Health’s Research</a>). Some common gender categories are: woman, man,
non-binary, genderqueer.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<b>What is sex?</b>
</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Sex is a biological categorization that is assigned at birth based on
anatomy, chromosomes, and/or hormones. It is primarily associated with
physical and physiological features of humans and animals
(<a href = "https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/48642.html">Canadian Institutes of
Health’s Research</a>). Sex categories are typically female, male, and
intersex, but there is variation in the biological attributes that
comprise sex, and they can change with or without medical intervention.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<b>If I study sex, how should I describe my results?</b>
</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
If you use the variable ‘sex’ in your research, avoid the terms women
and men when describing your observations, but instead use the
appropriate labels: female, male, and intersex people.
</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary>
<b>How could we be more inclusive?</b>
</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Throughout our research efforts, as well as when writing about our
results, it is important to be attentive toward the differences between
these two categories, as well as to be critical toward our quantitative
variables. Reflect on the implications of describing sex as a binary
variable. Which parts of the population are not represented in the data?
(Read more in
<a href = "https://doi.org/10.1080/19419899.2020.1729844">Lindqvist,
<i>What is gender, anyway</i></a>). Lastly,
<a href = "https://cps.ipums.org/cps/">IPUMS-CPS</a>, as many other
datasets, does not hold information about gender. How might these
datasets improve in the future?

<b>How could I explain this to someone else?</b>
</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">
Whenever you have doubts about the difference between gender and sex, a
friend of yours does, or you don’t know how to explain it to someone
else, ask The Genderbread Person!

<summary>
<b>Doesn’t race have a similar problem?</b>
</summary>
<p style="margin-left: 40px">

Yep. Race is also a social construct with definitions that vary across
societies, over time, and across interactions. The categories available
to respondents have changed over time in the
<a href = "https://www.pewresearch.org/interactives/what-census-calls-us/">Census</a>
and the
<a href = "https://cps.ipums.org/cps-action/variables/RACE#comparability_section">CPS</a>.
And race is multifaceted, so that any categorization might miss
<a href = "https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/09/harvard-sociology-professor-weighs-in-on-census-flaws/">important
aspects</a>. We must be mindful that the way we do science could
<a href = "https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520270312/the-nature-of-race">reinforce
this construct</a>.

Despite concerns, disparities across categories like sex and race are
important. It is worthwhile to use available data to study these
disparities, while recognizing the limits of the measured data.
