# Data analysis: Predicting income mobility

In this exercise, we will explore the degree to which survey respondents' incomes in adulthood can be predicted given information on their education and socioeconomic characteristics of their parents and grandparents.

This document introduces the data and then your task.

## Data

To download data for this exercise, visit the [exercise page](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/185941/version/V2/view) on OpenICPSR. You will need to register for an account and agree to terms. Then, you can download [for_students.zip](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/185941/version/V2/view?path=/openicpsr/185941/fcr:versions/V2/for_students.zip&type=file).

These data from the [Panel Study of Income Dynamics](https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/) (PSID) began with a sample of households in 1968. We will define people sampled in these households as the grandparent generation (g1). The PSID repeatedly surveyed these sample members over time. Further, the PSID interviewed their descendants. We therefore have information on the parent generation (g2) and the respondent generation (g3).

Begin with `learning.csv`

- The data contains one row for each of 1,365 respondents in generation g3
- The grandparent, parent, and respondent are identified by `g1_id`, `g2_id`, `g3_id`

We have prepared a few key variables

- Log income in each generation. After adjusting incomes to 2022 dollars, we took the average report at ages 30--45 and then logged this quantity
- Education in each generation
- Race reported in the grandparent generation
- Sex reported in the respondent generation

## Your task

Your task is to

- learn a function to predict `g3_log_income`
- using the other predictors in `learning.csv`
- with any statistical or machine learning method of your choosing

Then, predict `g3_log_income` for every case in `holdout_public.csv`

## How to submit

You will submit

- your predictions in a .csv file with two columns
    * `g3_id` for each case in `holdout_public`
    * `g3_log_income` with your prediction for each case
- your .R code file
