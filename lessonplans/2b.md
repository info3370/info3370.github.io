# Adding color and shape aesthetics

Today we will learn to plot more than one series in a single `ggplot`. We have already used the aesthetic arguments `x` and `y`. These map values in our `data.frame` to parameters of the graph. Two new aesthetics we will learn today are `color` and `shape`.

For this exercise, we will use p10p50p90.csv, which contains the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles all in one dataset.
