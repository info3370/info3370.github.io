# Interventions to promote equality

Descriptions of inequality are important, because they tell us about the society that currently exists. However, we may want to **intervene** to change society to promote equality.

Questions about interventions are inherently causal questions: they require us to think about what would happen if something were different. This module will introduce several key principles of causal inference, focusing on the specific example of the effect of college on socioeconomic outcomes. We will discuss classical statistical approaches and machine learning estimators.
