# Jan 27. Using R

Today we will begin using R! R is a powerful tool for data analysis.

## Before class

You should follow the instructions in R4DS [1.4](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#prerequisites) to

1. [Install R](https://cloud.r-project.org/), which is statistical software
2. [Install RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/download), which is a particular environment we will use to work with R
3. Install the `tidyverse` package as described in R4DS [1.4.3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html#the-tidyverse)

If you have trouble, post a question in Ed or ask in office hours. If something goes wrong with your computer so that you aren't fully set up it'll be ok---for this class session we'll just begin to get familiar with the R environment.

## During class

We will work with [median_income.csv](https://info3370.github.io/assets/data/median_income.csv), which contains the median U.S. household income from 1968 to 2022, adjusted for inflation to 2022 dollars.

You can load this into R by first loading [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and then loading the data.

```
library(tidyverse)
median_income <- read_csv("https://info3370.github.io/assets/data/median_income.csv")
```

In class, we will explore these data and visualize the trend in median U.S. household incomes.

## After class

You may want to read the other parts of R4DS [1](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html) which provide an overview of the approach to data science taken by this textbook.
