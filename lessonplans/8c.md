# Nonparametric (model-free) estimators of causal effects

This page illustrates nonparametric adjustment: how to estimate causal
effects without any statistical model at all. Although it is rarely used
in practice, nonparametric adjustment is a conceptually useful because
it illustrates the ideal case that we hope any statistical model will
approximate.

There are two steps:

1) Estimate effects within population subgroups defined by confounders

> Why? Within subgroups, confounders do not vary. Differences in outcomes must be caused by the treatment!

2) Aggregate over subgroups, weighted by size

> Why? The distribution of confounders stays the same, even if we intervene to change the treatment

We illustrate by estimating the causal effect of education on income,
where we assume that the causal effect is identified by statistical
adjustment for parent education according to the DAG below.

## Prepare: Load the data

First, prepare the environment and load data we used in the [PSID
Prediction
Challenge](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/185941).

``` r
library(tidyverse)
d <- read_csv("../psid_mobility_challenge/for_students/learning.csv") %>%
  # Optional: Modify g2_educ so that it is an ordered factor
  mutate(g2_educ = fct_relevel(g2_educ, 
                               "Less than high school",
                               "High school",
                               "Some college",
                               "College")) %>%
  # Optional: Rename variables to their roles for this lesson
  rename(id = g3_id,
         confounder = g2_educ,
         treatment = g3_educ,
         outcome = g3_log_income) %>%
  select(id, confounder, treatment, outcome) %>%
  print()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1,365 × 4
    ##       id confounder            treatment             outcome
    ##    <dbl> <fct>                 <chr>                   <dbl>
    ##  1     1 Less than high school High school             10.7 
    ##  2     4 High school           Some college            11.5 
    ##  3     7 High school           High school             11.2 
    ##  4     9 Less than high school High school             10.7 
    ##  5    10 Less than high school High school             10.7 
    ##  6    11 High school           Some college            11.3 
    ##  7    12 High school           Some college            11.5 
    ##  8    13 Less than high school Less than high school    9.99
    ##  9    19 High school           Less than high school   11.1 
    ## 10    21 High school           Less than high school   10.4 
    ## # … with 1,355 more rows

### Step 1. Create population subgroups and calculate conditional average effects

First, create population subgroups in which the confounders do not vary.

- within each subgroup, estimate the mean outcome in each treatment
  condition
- take the difference over treatment conditions of interest

This estimates **conditional average causal effects**: the average
effect of a treatment on an outcome within population subgroups

``` r
conditional_average_effect <- d %>%
  group_by(confounder, treatment) %>%
  summarize(ybar = mean(outcome),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = treatment, values_from = ybar) %>%
  # Focus on the effect of college vs high school
  select(confounder, `College`, `High school`) %>%
  mutate(effect_of_college = `College` - `High school`) %>%
  print()
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 4
    ##   confounder            College `High school` effect_of_college
    ##   <fct>                   <dbl>         <dbl>             <dbl>
    ## 1 Less than high school    11.5          10.8             0.740
    ## 2 High school              11.6          11.0             0.543
    ## 3 Some college             11.7          11.2             0.439
    ## 4 College                  11.7          11.4             0.304

### Step 2. Aggregate across subgroups

We might want a population claim: what is the average effect for
everyone? An intervention to send respondents to college would not
change the education of their parents. We will take the weighted average
of conditional average causal effects, weighted by the size of each
population subgroup.

First, calculate the size of each subgroup.

``` r
subpopulation_size <- d %>%
  group_by(confounder) %>%
  summarize(subgroup_size = n(),
            .groups = "drop") %>%
  print()
```

    ## # A tibble: 4 × 2
    ##   confounder            subgroup_size
    ##   <fct>                         <int>
    ## 1 Less than high school           192
    ## 2 High school                     664
    ## 3 Some college                    296
    ## 4 College                         213

Then, estimate the population average effect.

``` r
conditional_average_effect %>%
  left_join(subpopulation_size, by = "confounder") %>%
  summarize(population_average_effect = weighted.mean(effect_of_college, 
                                                      w = subgroup_size)) %>%
  print()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   population_average_effect
    ##                       <dbl>
    ## 1                     0.511

### Closing thoughts

Nonparametric adjustment illustrates a key concept: study the effect of a treatment by examining differences in outcomes across that treatment within subgroups defined by confounders.

In practice, there are often many confounders and
nonparametric adjustment becomes impossible. The next page discusses
parametric adjustment for those settings.
