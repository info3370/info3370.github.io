# Reproducibility with R Markdown

A key principle of data science is reproducibility: you should be able to hand your inputs and your code to a new researcher so that they can reproduce your result exactly. In this course, we will use R Markdown for assignments because it creates an output file that communicates results and embeds the code to produce those results.

This class is based on R4DS Ch [27](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html), which is a terrific resource on R Markdown.
