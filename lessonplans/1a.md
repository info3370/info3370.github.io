# Jan 23. Welcome to Info 3370 / 5371!

No preparation is needed before this class.

1. Make a name tag! We encourage you to put your name and pronouns
2. Meet others at your table
    - What was something fun for you over the break?
    - What are you looking forward to this semester?
3. Help us make our first seating chart: [tinyurl.com/Seats3370](https://tinyurl.com/Seats3370)

## Exercise

At each table, we have placed a visualization of inequality. Discuss:

- What is compelling about the figure?
- What do you find confusing?
- How would you explain this figure to someone who hasnâ€™t seen it?

Then we will discuss it as a class. Not every table has the same figure, so we will pick some groups randomly to walk the rest of us through each figure.

<details><summary>Are you an observer outside the class? Here are our three figures</summary>
<ul>
	<li> Figure 1 from <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1251936">Piketty and Saez (2014)</a> </li>
 	<li> Figure 2 from <a href = "https://doi.org/10.1086/671012">Schaefer and Edin (2013)</a> </li>
	<li> Figure 1 from <a href = "https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2022/demo/p60-277.pdf">U.S. Census Bureau (2022) </a> </li>
</ul>
