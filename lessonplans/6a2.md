# Racial segregation today

After discussing the [history of racist housing policies](../6a), we will use [Social Explorer](http://resolver.library.cornell.edu/misc/6268440) to map racial residential segregation today.

- Visit the resource
- Click "Explore" under United States
- Click "Change Data" in the top left
- Choose "Race" -> "Black or African American Alone"
- Zoom in on a city of your choosing. What do you see about segregation?
     - You may have to the geography level from "by County" to "by Tract"
