The examples on the documentation page are especially helpful. The R4DS section is also helpful.\nHere are two ways to use filter() to restrict to people working 50+ weeks per year. One way is to call the filter() function and hand it two arguments\n\n.data = micro is the dataset\nyear == 1962 is a logical condition coded TRUE for observations in 1962\n\n\nfilter(.data = micro, year == 1962)\n\nThe result of this call is a tibble with only the observations from 1962. Another way to do the same operation is with the pipe operator |&gt;\n\nmicro |&gt;\n  filter(year == 1962)\n\nThis approach begins with the data set micro. The pipe operator |&gt; hands this data set on as the first argument to the filter() function in the next line. As before, the second argument is the logical condition year == 1962.\nThe piping approach is often preferable because it reads like a sentence: begin with data, then filter to cases with a given condition. The pipe is also useful\nThe pipe operator |&gt; takes what is on the first line and hands it on as the first argument to the function in the next line. This reads in a sentence: begin with the micro tibble and then filter() to cases with year == 1962. The pipe can also string together many operations, with comments allowed between them:\n\nmicro |&gt;\n  # Restrict to 1962\n  filter(year == 1962) |&gt;\n  # Restrict to ages 40-44\n  filter(age &gt;= 40 & age &lt;= 44)\n\nYour turn. Begin with the micro dataset. Filter to\n\npeople working 50+ weeks per year (check documentation for wkswork2)\nvalid report of incwage greater than 0 and less than 99999998\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nfiltered should have 1,350,542 rows and 16 columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nFiltering can be a dangerous business! For example, above we dropped people with missing values of income. But what if the lowest-income people refuse to answer the income question? We often have no choice but to filter to those with valid responses, but you should always read the documentation to be sure you understand who you are dropping and why."

In today’s reading, Jencks discusses how quantitative empirical evidence on inequality relates to arguments about the amount of inequality that is desirable.\nAfter our discussion in class, read p. 49–53 of this paper:\nThe paper’s engagement with both normative arguments and quantitative evidence is an example we will follow this semester.\nUltimately, this class is creative: you will produce new evidence about a question of your choosing. To get there, we first need to learn a bit about population data and how to work with those data."
