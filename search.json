For office hours, see the Syllabus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIan Lundberg\nilundberg@cornell.edu\n(he / him)\nWorking with data to understand inequality brings me joy and meaning, as I first discovered as a college student years ago. I hope to share that joy with you! Other joys of mine include hiking, surfing, and oatmeal with blueberries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFederica Bologna\nfb265@cornell.edu\n(she / her)\nI am passionate about using data to support patient-centered care and study gender inequality in fiction readership. I love binge-watching shows, hiking, and making food with friends. Excited to meet you in class!\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Molitor\ndmolitor@infosci.cornell.edu\nMy research interests primarily focus on applying computational methods to important policy questions. Developing software and building tools is also something I love to do! In my free time I enjoy doing pretty much anything that’s active and outdoors and I particularly enjoy playing tennis, kayaking, and fishing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStacy Boey\n(she / her)\nHi everyone! I am an information science major concentrating in data science and UX. Some hobbies of mine include crocheting, thrifting, and cooking. I look forward to a great semester with you guys!\n\n\n\n\n\nChang Chen\nHi everyone! I study biometry and information science, concentrating on data science. I enjoy playing badminton and cooking. I look forward to working with all of you!\n\n\n\n\n\nOlaf de Rohan Willner\nHello everyone! I study Information Science and Government and am fascinated by understanding the world and how policies shape it through data. Outside of class I love watching 1950’s French movies, running, and cooking. Looking forward to meeting you all this semester!\n\n\n\n\n\nAkira Goh\nHi everyone, I am a Dyson and Infoscience double major. I love scubadiving, snowboarding, and working out. Excited to be working with all of you.\n\n\n\n\n\nJonathan Gotian\n(he / him)\nHi all, I am a Dyson major and pursuing an Information Science minor studying business analytics and data science.
